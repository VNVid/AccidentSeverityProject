# Accident Severity Project
The Road Accident Severity project aimed to enhance road safety by developing a machine learning model to predict accident severity and analyzing risk factors. The project used UK road accident data from 2005 to 2017, focusing on various factors like road conditions, weather, traffic volume, and driver behavior. The data preprocessing involved handling missing values, feature transformation, and dealing with imbalanced data. Models used included Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and CatBoost, with CatBoost being the most effective. The project's analysis led to proposals for improved lighting, speed limit regulation, targeted education on vehicle maneuvers, and age-specific driving policies. The complete implementation details are available on 'project.ipynb'. The detailed description and anlyses could be found in 'Report.pdf'.
